#VERY VERY IMPORTANT

'''os=folder retrieval and file path handling
yaml=configuration management
DATA_DIR=directory to scan for files
SUPPORTED_FORMATS=set of file extensions to process(in config)
@staticmethod=method that can be called without creating an instance of the class
scan method=walks through the directory and yields file paths that match supported formats
for root, _, files in os.walk(DATA_DIR)=traverse the directory tree
os.path.splitext(file_name)[1].lower()=get file extension and convert to lowercase
if extension in SUPPORTED_FORMATS=check if the file extension is supported
yield os.path.join(root, file_name)=return the full path of the file for processing
